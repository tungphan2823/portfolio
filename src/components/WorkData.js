For student removal, design an intuitive interface with backend logic to maintain data integrity during the removal process. In course management, develop forms for administrators to add and edit course details, incorporating validation for accuracy. Implement a system for archiving or deleting courses as needed.For search functionality, build a robust student search feature, allowing administrators to quickly locate students using filters such as name, enrollment date, or course enrollment. Enable ongoing enrollment monitoring by creating a dynamic dashboard that fetches real-time information from the database, providing administrators with insights into student progress. Consider implementing security measures, including proper authentication and authorization, to control access. Additionally, incorporate logging mechanisms to track changes for auditing purposes. Provide clear feedback messages for user operations, and thoroughly test the system to identify and address any bugs before deployment. Adapt these steps to your specific web development stack, leveraging technologies such as React JS, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and suitable backend technologies.",
